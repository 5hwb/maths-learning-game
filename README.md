# Maths Learning Game

This is a simple game for Android that tests the player's knowledge of mathematical concepts through a series of randomly generated multiple-choice questions. It is inspired by language learning apps like Duolingo.

## TODO

* Add a score system
* Add more question generators for more question varieties (surds, factorials etc)
